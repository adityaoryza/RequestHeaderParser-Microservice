# Request Header Parser Microservice
## Description : 
This is a simple Node.js and Express web application that provides an API endpoint to parse the user's request header and return some information about their browser and operating system. This project was built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs certification.

The API endpoint accepts a GET request at '/api/whoami', and returns a JSON object with the client's IP address, preferred languages, and user-agent string. The implementation uses the Express framework to handle the routes and the 'request' object to extract the headers.

This application can be used as a starter project for building microservices with Node.js and Express, and can be easily deployed on platforms like Heroku or Glitch.

Feel free to use this project as a reference or as a starting point for your own microservices projects. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
